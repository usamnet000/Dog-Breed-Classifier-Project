# Dog-Breed-Classifier

In this project, I build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify the breed of dog from any user-supplied image. If the image is of a human and not a dog, the algorithm will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

The code is written in Python 3 and Keras with Tensorflow backend all presented in Jupyter Notebook.

## Principal Objectives

• Classify dog chains correctly and accurately
• Provide time for the user to determine the type and variety, whether for humans or dogs
• Choose the best classification algorithms to achieve the two previous goals
